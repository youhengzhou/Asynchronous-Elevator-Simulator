Running system in eclipse. 
input_events.csv includes one line out of the six that throws a motor errors: "1,2,Up,3,0,1".
It is expected that the elevator subsystem will schedule the event and the elevator it is scheduled to will stop.

The Elevator Subsystem output the information below, showing the Motor Error functioning properly.
